# Your StdLib Slack App

Welcome to your StdLib Slack Source Code! This Source Code is the fastest way to
get a production-ready Slack app running in your channel. All you have to do is
swap some environment variables and press deploy!

This readme will walk you through the layout of your Slack App  __after__ you
install the source code. It will go over how to handle Slack Slash Commands,
Events, and Actions from interactive messages.

# Your Project

The first thing you'll probably notice is your `functions/` directory. This is
your StdLib function directory which maps directly to HTTP endpoints. There are
five main functions in your Slack App:

- `__main__.js`
- `auth.js`
- `commands/__main__.js`
- `events/__main__.js`
- `actions/__main__.js`

We'll go through these in the order listed here.

## Function: `functions/__main__.js`

This is your main endpoint, corresponding to `https://username.lib.id/service/`.
This is, of course, where `username` is your username and `service` is your service
name.

Any time a function has the filename `__main__.js`, the enclosing folder is
used as the route name over HTTP. You can think of it like the default function
for a specific directory.

Note that when pushing to a development environment (or if you want to access
  a specific version), this should be reached via:
  `https://username.lib.id/service@dev/main` (if your dev environment is called
  `dev`, also the default local environment name) or
  `https://username.lib.id/service@0.0.0/main` (if your version is 0.0.0).

### Usage

This endpoint generates a template based on the contents of `pages/index.ejs`,
which is modifiable and contains your "Add to Slack" button. It is the easiest
way to distribute your app to other users.

## Function: `functions/auth.js`

This is the OAuth endpoint for your Slack App that verifies another team (or your
  own) has properly validated the slack app.

### Usage

This endpoint processes an OAuth request and returns the contents of
`slack/pages/auth.ejs`. (Typically "Success!" if successful.)

## Function: `functions/commands/__main__.js`

This is the main **Command Handler** function for handling Slack Slash Commands.
You can read more about them here: https://api.slack.com/slash-commands

This function is triggered by slack at the following URL:
`https://<username>.lib.id/<service>@<ver>/commands/:bg`

Where `<username>` is your username, `<service>` is the service name and
`<ver>` is the environment or semver release of your service. The `:bg`
indicates you'd like this function to return an HTTP 2XX code as quickly as
possible and do all processing behind the scenes. (Ideal for Slack.)

### Usage

To add or modify Slash commands, you'll want to look in the directory
`functions/commands/` and create files with the name
`functions/commands/NAME.js` where `NAME` is your intended command,
and also add them to your Slash Commands list via Slack's Slash Command interface.

For the default "hello" command (should be added as `/hello` to your app) you'll
notice the following boilerplate code:

```javascript
module.exports = (user, channel, text = '', command = {}, botToken = null, callback) => {

  callback(null, {
    response_type: 'in_channel',
    text: `Hello, <@${user}>...\nYou said: ${text}`
  });

};
```

In this function, `user` and `channel` are strings representing the user and
channel the command was called from. The contents of the command (text) are
available in `text`, a full `command` object is available
that contains all data passed from slack (https://api.slack.com/slash-commands),
and a botToken for your Slack App's bot is passed in (if you want to use it
  to post additional messages, upload files, etc.).

The first parameter passed to `callback` is an error (if present), use `new Error()`
when possible. The second parameter is a `chat.postMessage` object,
more details can be found here: https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage.

You can test the sample hello command on the command line by running

```shell
$ lib .commands.hello test_user general "some text"
```

## Function: `functions/events/__main__.js`

This is the main **Event Handler** function for handling public channel events
from Slack's Event API: https://api.slack.com/events

This function is triggered by slack at the following URL:
`https://<username>.lib.id/<service>@<ver>/events/:bg`

Where `<username>` is your username, `<service>` is the service name and
`<ver>` is the environment or semver release of your service. The `:bg`
indicates you'd like this function to return an HTTP 2XX code as quickly as
possible.

You'll notice an `* @bg params` line in the comments for this function. This
means, when executed as a background function, it will return a JSON object
mapping to the parameters passed to it (which also passes Slack's `challenge`
litmus test).

### Usage

This function will delegate incoming events to their appropriate handler,
which can be placed in `functions/events/TYPE.js` or `functions/events/TYPE/__main__.js`
as these are functionally equivalent. If there is a subtype involved,
`functions/events/TYPE/SUBTYPE.js` or `functions/events/TYPE/SUBTYPE/__main__.js`
will be invoked.

By default your `functions/events/message/__main__.js` should look like this:

```javascript
module.exports = (user, channel, text = '', event = {}, botToken = null, callback) => {

  // Only send a response to certain messages
  if (text.match(/hey|hello|hi|sup/i)) {
    callback(null, {
      text: `Hey there! <@${user}> said ${text}`
    });
  } else {
    callback(null, {});
  }

};
```

In this function, `user` and `channel` are strings representing the user and
channel the event was triggered by. The contents of the command (text) are
available in `text`, a full `event` object is available
that contains all data passed from slack (https://api.slack.com/events),
and a `botToken` for your Slack App's bot is passed in (if you want to use it
  to post additional messages, upload files, etc.).

The first parameter passed to `callback` is an error (if present), use `new Error()`
when possible. The second parameter is a `chat.postMessage` object,
more details can be found here: https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage.

You can test the sample message event on the command line by running:

```shell
$ lib .events.message test_user general "hello"
```

## Function: `functions/actions/__main__.js`

This is the main **Action Handler** function for handling Slack Actions from
interactive messages. You can read more about actions and interactive messages
here: https://api.slack.com/docs/message-buttons.

This function is triggered by slack at the following URL:
`https://<username>.lib.id/<service>@<ver>/actions/:bg`.
You should add this URL to the interactive messages section of your Slack app
dashboard.

Where `<username>` is your username, `<service>` is the service name and
`<ver>` is the environment or semver release of your service. The `:bg`
indicates you'd like this function to return an HTTP 2XX code as quickly as
possible.

### Usage

This function will delegate incoming actions to their appropriate handler,
which should be placed in `functions/actions/NAME.js`.

We've included a simple sample handler for an action named `example`. The code
for this is below:

```javascript
module.exports = (user, channel, action = {}, botToken = null, callback) => {

  callback(null, {
    text: `Hello, <@${user}>!\nThis text will overwrite the original interactive message`,
    attachments: [{
      text: 'Try hitting this endpoint again by clicking the button!',
      fallback: 'Can\'t display attachment',
      callback_id: 'callback_id',
      actions: [
        {
          name: 'example',
          text: 'Refresh',
          type: 'button',
          value: 'value'
        }
      ]
    }]
  });

};
```

In this function, `user` and `channel` are again strings representing the user
and channel the event was triggered by. A full `action` object is available
that contains all data passed from Slack
(https://api.slack.com/docs/interactive-message-field-guide#action_payload),
and a `botToken` for your Slack App's bot is passed in (if you want to use it
  to post additional messages, upload files, etc.).

The first parameter passed to `callback` is an error (if present), use `new Error()`
when possible. The second parameter is a `chat.updateMessage` object,
more details can be found here: https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.update.

Whatever you choose to return in the second callback parameter will
__overwrite__ the original message. This parameter could be a confirmation
message or another call to action. This value can be a simple string or an
object that conforms to the spec set in `chat.update`
(see https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.update. We automatically
attach the token, ts, and channel params for you outside of this handler). You
can also restore the original message in case of an error by returning Slack's
`original_message` parameter, which will be present in the `action` parameter.

You could create a interactive message that would trigger this handler with the
following Javascript code (you will have to run `npm install slack --save`
first):

```javascript
const slack = require('slack');

slack.chat.postMessage({
 token: process.env.BOT_TOKEN,
 channel: '#general',
 text: 'Respond to this',
 attachments: [{
   text: 'Here is the action:',
   actions: [
     {
       name: 'example',
       text: 'Press me',
       type: 'button'
     }
   ]
 }]
}, (err, result) => {
 // Handle result
});
```

You can retrieve your bot token from the OAuth and Permissions section of your
Slack dashboard.

Additionally, you can test the example action locally from your command line by
running:

```shell
lib .actions --name example --channel general --user user
```

**Note:** Your action handlers will only work with messages created via the
`slack.chat.postMessage` API call.

# Utilities

This Slack App template comes with some utility function in `slack/utils`.
We'll go over a few of them;

- message.js
- update_message.js
- respond.js
- upload.js

## Utility: `utils/message.js`

This function has a fingerprint of:

```javascript
module.exports = (token, channel, text, callback) => {}
```

Where `token` is your bot token (the token used for the bot response),
`channel` as the channel where the response is expected, `text` being a
string or `channel.postMessage` object (for more granular control),
and `callback` being a function expecting one parameter (an `error`, if applicable)
that executes the call.

Use this function to get your bot to send messages to users or channels --- that's
it. The `token` field should be passed in any `slack/commands` or `slack/events`
handlers.

## Utility: `utils/update_message.js`

This function has a fingerprint of:

```javascript
module.exports = (token, channel, ts, message, callback) => {}
```

Where `token` is your bot token (the token used for the bot response),
`channel` as the channel where the response is expected, `ts` as the timestamp
of the message being updated, `message` being a string or `chat.update` object
(for more granular control) that will replace the original message, and
`callback` being a function expecting one parameter (an `error`, if applicable)
that executes the call.

Use this function to get your bot to update messages in channels.

## Utility: `utils/respond.js`

Very similar to `message.js`, this is a Slash Command response that `HTTP POST`s
a message to a webhook endpoint instead of creating a new bot message directly.

The benefits this has over `message.js`, is that Slash Commands can be used in
private channels (or globally, within a team) where applicable.

## Utility: `utils/upload.js`

Similar to `message.js`, this function has a fingerprint of:

```javascript
module.exports = (token, channel, filename, contentType, file, callback) => {}
```

Where `token` is your bot token, `channel` is the channel to upload a file to,
`filename` is the desired filename, `contentType` is the desired content type
(i.e. a string like `image/png`), file is a `Buffer` of file contents
and `callback` is a function that can handle an optional `err` parameter.

# Helpers

There are a few helper functions for message formatting, etc. Feel free to
look at them at your leisure, we've documented `storage.js` to better understand
how team data is stored.

## Helper: `helpers/storage.js`

This is a storage helper based upon https://stdlib.com/utils/storage. It
is a basic key-value store that saves crucial team (including bot) details
about each and every team its installed on, specific to the `SLACK_APP_NAME`
field in your `env.json` and your StdLib (https://stdlib.com) account. You
should probably avoid interfacing with this function directly, but it should
be noted that it is *critical* for the ability to install your app on
multiple teams.

# That's it!

We hope this has served as a welcoming introduction to your
Slack App project scaffold on [StdLib](https://stdlib.com) --- happy building!
